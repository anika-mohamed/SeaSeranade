      <h2>What is SDG 14- Life Below Water?</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) aims to protect and sustainably
        use the life below water, which is crucial to our planet's ecosystem.
        Oceans, covering more than 70% of the Earth's surface, play a vital role
        in regulating the climate, providing food, and supporting diverse
        ecosystems. However, human activities such as overfishing, pollution,
        coastal development, and climate change have severely impacted marine
        health and biodiversity.
        <br>
        <br>
        SDG 14 emphasizes the urgent need to conserve and sustainably manage
        oceans, seas, and marine resources. A key aspect of this goal is the
        protection and restoration of marine ecosystems, including coral reefs
        and mangroves. These habitats support a wide variety of marine life and
        act as natural defenses against coastal erosion and storms, benefiting
        coastal communities.
        <br >
        <br >
        A central focus of SDG 14 is the sustainable management of fisheries.
        Overfishing has drastically reduced fish populations, jeopardizing the
        livelihoods of millions who rely on these resources for food and income.
        Implementing sustainable fishing practices, such as setting catch
        limits, combating illegal fishing, and promoting ecosystem-based
        management, is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability of
        fisheries and the preservation of marine biodiversity.
        <br>
        <br>
        SDG 14 serves as a guiding light for protecting marine life, a critical 
        component of our planet's ecosystem. With oceans covering more than 70% of the 
        Earth's surface, they are vital for climate regulation, food supply, and 
        supporting diverse ecosystems. However, human activities such as overfishing, 
        pollution, coastal development, and climate change have severely impacted 
        marine health and biodiversity worldwide.
